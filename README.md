# highly skilled job offers Tips
Here I share some tips about CV/Resume and Interviews to get a job offer easily 

## 1- CV/Resume:
#### Make a standard ATS compatible CV
What is ATS compatible? An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software application that read your CV/Resume and give the human resources some results. In many cases they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended. This has caused many to adapt resume optimization techniques similar to those used in search engine optimization when creating and formatting their résumé.
