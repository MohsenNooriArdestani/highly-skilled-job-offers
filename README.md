## 1- CV/Resume:
#### Make a standard ATS-compatible CV
What is ATS compatible? An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software application that reads your CV/Resume and gives human resources some results. In many cases, they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended. This has caused many to adopt resume optimization techniques similar to those used in search engine optimization when creating and formatting their résumé.

#### What Does a Good Resume Look Like?
A good Resume Should have a good structure here you can find some real samples:

- [Microsoft Work template](https://www.careercup.com/resume)
- [Latex format](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) (I prefer latex)

#### How to optimize my CV?
Remember recruiters will only check your CV for less than a minute so it should follow lots of factors like if you have less than 10 years of experience your CV should be a 1-page long page. You can use these tools to improve your CV:
- [Resumeworded](https://resumeworded.com) (It's free)

## 2- How to find or apply for a job?
#### Recruiters
Make some connections (in Linkedin or other platforms) with recruiters in the country you wanna move to.

## 3- Schedule the interview

## 5- Mock Interview
Find a colleague or friend and have a mock interview with her/him
## 6- The Interview itself
Companies have different structures some will start with a personal human resource interview and some will drop you an online assignment first but there are usually three parts.
#### Introduction call
Try to have a structure when you introduce yourself (introduction can be between 3-5 mins), I will suggest this structure but you are free to use it or not (this is based on my experience):
- About yourself: Start with your name/age and where are you living (30 secs)
- About the current company: Company name, size, Industry, B2B? B2C?
- About the team: Team size, Teamwork methodologies
- About the latest project and technologies: Eg: We are building a payment application with Java11, Spring boot, Automated CI/CD, Oauth, Microservices, and Kafka, ...
#### Technical interview
You may see this is like the previous one! YEAH! but now you give them a little bit more technical info:
- About yourself: Start with your name/age and where are you living (30 secs)
- About the current company: Company name, size, Industry, B2B? B2C?
- About the team: Team size, Teamwork methodologies
- About the latest project and technologies: Eg: We are building a payment application by Java11, Spring boot, TDD, and Oauth, we have 17 Microservices, a Kafka cluster with 10 nodes, Docker, AWS, Automated CI/CD, Sonar, ...
#### Final talk over contract and bonuses (relocation package and ...)
- How much you should pay as normal rent (the most important issue after getting a visa is finding a house and how they can help you in this process)
- Ask them about the relocation package
- Contract starting day (Can you start remotely!?)
- Visa process
- Company car
- Number of salaries in a year (12 or 13), Tax, holiday allowance
