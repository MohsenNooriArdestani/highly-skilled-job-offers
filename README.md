## 1- CV/Resume:
#### Make a standard ATS-compatible CV
What is ATS compatible? An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software application that reads your CV/Resume and gives human resources some results. In many cases, they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended. This has caused many to adopt resume optimization techniques similar to those used in search engine optimization when creating and formatting their résumé.

#### What Does a Good Resume Look Like?
A good Resume Should have a good structure here you can find some real samples:

- [Microsoft Work template](https://www.careercup.com/resume)
- [Latex format](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) (I prefer latex)

#### How to optimize my CV?
Remember recruiters will only check your CV for less than a minute so it should follow lots of factors like if you have less than 10 years of experience your CV should be a 1-page long page. You can use these tools to improve your CV:

## 2- How to find or apply for a job?

## 3- Schedule the interview
It's a common mistake that you have an interview in another time zone and you miss the interview because of miscalculations. With [Calendly](https://calendly.com) you can easily set up your calendar and ask people to find a free slot in your calendar.

## 4- Skills
<p align="center"><img src="files/soft_vs_hard_skills.png" /></p>
Let's go into a little bit more detail.


#### Soft skills
Personal attributes that enable someone to interact effectively and harmoniously with other people. It's not a good idea to put soft skills directly on a CV (like "team player"), but it'd be good to mention them under the hood in the CV bullet points. Following you can find some youtube content that can help you in this particular area. This is also the list of soft-skill questions they will ask you through the interview: 
<p align="center"><img src="files/top_10_interview_questions.jpg" /></p>

#### Improve Soft skills

- [Interview Question: Tell Me About Yourself | Best Answer for Freshers & Experienced People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzGH3hZuJVk)
#### Hard skills
Hard skills are objective, quantifiable skills gained through training, school, or work experiences. Hard skills are often usually something that can be taught or learned. If you are a Software Engineer and you write code in Java, then Java is one of your hard skills. Examples of software engineer hard skills:
- Software development
- Object-oriented design (OOD)
- Software testing, debugging
- Computer programming and coding

You can find the full list with details in [uiowa](https://careers.uiowa.edu/careerbuzz/201509/10-things-do-right-interview)

## 6- Mock Interview
Find a colleague or friend and have a mock interview with her/him
## 7- The Interview itself
Companies have different structures some will start with a personal human resource interview and some will drop you an online assignment first but there are usually three parts.
#### Introduction call
Try to have a structure when you introduce yourself (introduction can be between 3-5 mins), I will suggest this structure but you are free to use it or not (this is based on my experience):
- About yourself: Start with your name/age and where are you living (30 secs)
- About the current company: Company name, size, Industry, B2B? B2C?
- About the team: Team size, Teamwork methodologies
- About the latest project and technologies: Eg: We are building a payment application with Java11, Spring boot, Automated CI/CD, Oauth, Microservices, and Kafka, ...
#### Technical interview
You may see this is like the previous one! YEAH! but now you give them a little bit more technical info:
- About yourself: Start with your name/age and where are you living (30 secs)
- About the current company: Company name, size, Industry, B2B? B2C?
- About the team: Team size, Teamwork methodologies
- About the latest project and technologies: Eg: We are building a payment application by Java11, Spring boot, TDD, and Oauth, we have 17 Microservices, a Kafka cluster with 10 nodes, Docker, AWS, Automated CI/CD, Sonar, ...
#### Final talk over contract and bonuses (relocation package and ...)
- How much you should pay as normal rent (the most important issue after getting a visa is finding a house and how they can help you in this process)
- Ask them about the relocation package
- Contract starting day (Can you start remotely!?)
- Visa process
- Company car
- Number of salaries in a year (12 or 13), Tax, holiday allowance
## 8- Interview Improvement process
<p align="center"><img src="files/continuous_improvement_process.png" /></p>
We always need to improve ourselves, simply try to find our weaknesses and make a list of them, then try to improve them. As an example:

- If you are not a good listener you can google this "How to be a good listener"
- You have some lacks in muti-thread programming, just try to take a course or start a small project to improve yourself
#### How To Identify Personal Weaknesses
You can use online tools or just ask from the other people:
- Google this "free MBTI test" if you are not an english native speaker it's better to use your own language tools. 
- Use blog like: [Wikihow: How to Identify Your Strengths and Weaknesses](https://www.wikihow.com/Identify-Your-Strengths-and-Weaknesses) or [bpalns: How to Identify Your Strengths and Weaknesses](https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-identify-your-strengths-and-weaknesses/)

This is the process, and don't forget the compound effect is still there ^_^ After getting the feedback you may back to your CV or Mock Interview, no worries you just need to keep going.

Good luck to you

Ario
